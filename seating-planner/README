Seating Planner
---------------

This application read from a text file the list of tables and parties.
It parses the lines to extract tables and parties information and save 
them in a separate lists.

Functionalities:
----------------

Main function ask for file name and call utility class SeatingHelper to
extract information from text file and creates tables and parties object.
Objects are added to their respective lists.

From SeatingHelper, seating function will start assigning the tables to
the parties.  In order to do the seating, the list of tables and the list
of parties are sorted on decreasing order. In this format the parties with
higher numbers will be seated on the tables with higher capacity. If there
is an equality in number then the party with dislike option gets the priority
over the one without. This will helps to seat the parties with dislike option
on any available table that can accept them. This way we can avoid the need to
swap the parties at the tables.

In case an error where a party can't find a table, the program will stop planning
and exit the program.


Execution:
----------

To run the application, build it first:  
	mvn clean install
 	java -jar target/seating-planner-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


Improvement:
------------

This program can be improved to avoid duplicate entries. We could use Set<T> interface 
to store Parties and tables information.
